# Cursor Rules - Team Cookbook Integration

# Before any code generation, read the team cookbook
Read ./team-cookbook/_index.yaml first for context, patterns, and constraints.

# Critical workflow
1. Load: team-cookbook/_index.yaml (navigation + context)
2. Check: constraints/ files (boundaries)
3. Follow: patterns/ files (templates)
4. Reference: examples/ files (working code)

# Quick reference lookup
Use quick_reference section in _index.yaml to find exact pattern locations for common tasks.

# Validation
All generated code must pass validation against constraints defined in team-cookbook/constraints/

# For complete instructions
See AGENTS.md in repository root for detailed workflow and examples.

# Team patterns take precedence
When team cookbook conflicts with general knowledge, follow the cookbook.
